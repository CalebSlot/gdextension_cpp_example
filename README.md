A Godot Project for learning purpose to test this Engine capabilitie, using the built in Editor, External Tools, c#, cpp (GDExtension) and their interoperability.
I Never used Godot before and had lot of time without programming cpp.. so i started directly from GDExtension then touching other parts of the engine following the docs when needed.
As IDES i used mainly Visual Studio and VScode. To build the stuff with cpp scons is needed, so python too.
